# No Purple Color Rule

**STRICT RULE**: The use of the color **Purple** (and its variations like Violet, Indigo, etc.) is **PROHIBITED** in this application.

## Instructions

1. **Replacement**: Always use **Blue** (e.g., `#3b82f6`, `#2563eb`, or `var(--primary)`) instead of Purple.
2. **CSS Variables**: Do not define or use variables like `--purple`, `--violet`. Rename them to `--blue-accent` or similar if needed, or point them to blue color codes.
3. **Class Names**: Avoid class names containing `purple` or `violet`. Use `blue` or functional names instead.
4. **Design System**: All components, buttons, icons, and themes that were previously purple must be converted to Blue.

## Exceptions

- None. Blue is the new Purple.
