description: When you find any problems or issues, fix them immediately without asking the user for permission

# Auto-Fix Rule

When you discover any of the following issues during your work:

- Code errors or bugs
- CSS conflicts or duplicates
- Missing translations
- Broken functionality
- Incomplete code
- Any other problems

**You MUST fix them immediately without asking the user.**

Do NOT:

- Ask "Do you want me to fix this?"
- Wait for user confirmation
- Just report issues without fixing

Do:

- Fix the issue right away
- Report what you fixed after the fact
- Continue with the original task
