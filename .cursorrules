# User Rules

1. **Language**: You must always respond to the user in **Arabic** (العربية), unless the user explicitly asks for another language.
2. **Context**: Ensure technical terms are explained in Arabic or kept in English if they are standard code terms, but the explanation must be in Arabic.
3. **Documentation**: After significant modifications and verifying they are free of issues or bugs, you must update `README.md`.
- **Self-Verification:** Before completing any task, ALWAYS run 'npx tsc --noEmit' to check for TypeScript errors. If errors are found, fix them immediately. Do not report completion until the code is error-free.
